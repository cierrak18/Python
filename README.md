- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Cierra.
- 👀 This repository is where I explore data visualization, cleaning, and filtering large datasets using Python.
- 🌱 I’m building my skills in organizing messy data, creating meaningful visuals, and experimenting with tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- 💞️ I’m open to feedback, collaboration, or ideas for improving how data is represented and understood.
- 📫 You can reach me at ibritt.cierra@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I find cleaning data oddly relaxing—it’s like solving a giant digital puzzle!
